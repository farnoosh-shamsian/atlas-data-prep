In front of the large central doors (βασίλειος θύρα) there is an altar; a smaller altar stands also near each of the two side-doors: see verse 16. Suppliants—old men, youths, and young children—are seated on the steps of the altars. They are dressed in white tunics and cloaks, —their hair bound with white fillets. On the altars they have laid down olive-branches wreathed with fillets of wool. The PRIEST OF ZEUS, a venerable man, is alone standing, facing the central doors of the palace. These are now thrown open: followed by two attendants (πρόσπολοι), who place themselves on either side of the doors, OEDIPUS enters, in the robes of a king: for a moment he gazes silently on the groups at the altars, and then speaks. See Appendix, Note 1, sect. 1."}

Or that ye have set your hearts (στέρξαντες)on some particular boon which I can grant?”—Others render στέρξαντες “having acquiesced.” This admits of two views. (i) “Are ye afraid of suffering? Or have ye already learned to bear suffering?” To this point the glosses ὑπομείναντες, παθόντες. But this seems unmeaning. He knows that the suffering has come, and he does not suppose that they are resigned to it (cp. v. 58).

This is ingenious and attractive. But (a) it appears hardly consonant with the kingly courtesy of this opening speech for Oedipus to assume that their belief in his good-will would reconcile them to their present miseries. (b) We seem to require some direct and express intimation of the king's willingness to help, such as the words ὡς θέλοντος … πᾶν give only when referred to φράζε. (c) The rhythm seems to favour the question at στέρξαντες. —στέξαντες, explained as “having endured,” may be rejected, because (1) the sense is against it—see on (i) above: (2) στέγειν in classical Greek = “to be proof against,” not “to suffer”: (3) στέξω, ἔστεξα are unknown to Attic, which has only the pres. and the imperf. ὡς θέλοντος ἂν (to be connected with φράζε) implies the apodosis of a conditional sentence. Grammatically, this might be either (a) εἰ δυναίμην, θέλοιμι ἄν, or (b) εἰ ἠδυνάμην, ἤθελον ἄν: here, the sense fixes it to (a). ὡς , thus added to the gen. absol., expresses the supposition on which the agent acts.

The name Καδμεία was given especially to the S. eminence of the upper town, the acropolis. (1) One of the ἀγοραί meant here was on a hill to the north of the acropolis, and was the ἀγορὰ Καδμείας. See Paus. 9.12.3. (2) The other was in the lower town. Xen.

Athena Ζωστηρία, too, had statues at Thebes (Paus. 9.17.3). The schol. mentions also Ἀλαλκομενία, but her shrine was at the village of Alalcomenae near Haliartus (Paus. 9.23.5).

Hal. Comp. Verb. 15 ad fin. has ἡ τῆς διανοίας ἔκτασις καὶ τὸ τοῦ δείματος ἀπροσδόκητον. Cp. Xen. Cyrop. 1.3.11 ἕως παρατείναιμι τοῦτον, ὥσπερ οὗτος ἐμὲ παρατείνει ἀπὸ σοῦ κωλύων, —‘rack,’ ‘torture’ him. But παρατείνεσθαι, when used figuratively, usually meant “to be worn out,” “fatigued to death”: e.g. Plat. Lysis 204c παραταθήσεται ὑπὸ σοῦ ἀκούων θαμὰ λέγοντος, enecabitur, he will be tired to death of hearing it. So Xen. Mem. 3.13.6 παρατέταμαι μακρὰν ὁδὸν πορευθείς. Triclinius explains here, “I am prostrated by dread”(ἐκπέπληγμαι, παρ’ ὅσον οἱ ἐκπλαγέντες ἔκτασιν σώματος καὶ ἀκινησίαν πάσχουσιν: cp. Eur. Med. 585 ἓν γὰρ ἐκτενεῖ σ’ ἔπος) : so Soph. Phil. 858 ἐκτέταται νύχιος (of a sleeper). But the context favours the other view. πάλλων transitive, governing φρένα, making my heart to shake; not intransitive, for παλλόμενος, with φρένα as accus. of the part affected. An intransitive use of πάλλω in this figurative sense is not warranted by such instances as Aristoph. Lys. 1304 κοῦφα πάλλων, “lightly leaping in the dance”: Eur. El. 435 ἔπαλλε δελφίς ( = ἐσκίρτἀ, “the dolphin leaped”: Eur. El. 477 ἵπποι ἔπαλλον “quivered” (in death). Cp. Aesch. PB 881 κραδία φόβῳ φρένα λακτίζει : so, when the speaker is identified with the troubled spirit within him, we can say φρένα πάλλω, —where φρένα has a less distinctly physical sense than in Aesch. PB 881, yet has physical associations which help to make the phrase less harsh."}

Il. 18.504, cited by Casaubon on Theophr. Char. 2.4,ἱερῷ ἐνὶ κύκλῳ refers merely to the γέροντες in council. This is better than (1) “her round seat in the agora”— κυκλόεντα meaning that the pedestal of the statue was circular; (2) “her throne in the agora, round which κύκλιοι χοροί range themselves.” This last is impossible. εὐκλέα , alluding to Artemis Εὔκλεια, the vipgin goddess of Faip Fame, wopshirred esr. by Locpians and Boeotians: Plut.

Pausanias saw a temple of Ἄρτεμις Εὔκλεια, with a statue by Scopas, near the Προιτίδες πύλαι on the N.E. side of Thebes. Near it were statues of Apollo Boedromios and Hermes Agoraios. The latter suggests that the Agora of the Lower Town (which was deserted when Pausanias visited Thebes) may have been near. In mentioning the ἀγορά, Soph. may have been further influenced by the fact that Artemis was worshipped as Ἀγοραία: thus in the altis at Olympia there was an Ἀρτεμίδος Ἀγοραίας βωμός near that of Ζεὺς Ἀγοραῖος (Paus. 5.15.4)."}

His view agrees with that given in my second ed., so far as concerns two points, viz.: (1) that the chief protasis is not contained in μὴ οὐκ ἔχων: and (2) that μὴ οὐκ ἔχων is still necessarily conditional. But his analysis of the whole is simpler; it is as follows. The chief protasis is contained in the word αὐτός, “unaided,” which is equivalent to, εἰ μόνος ἴχνευον, if I were attempting to trace it alone. [;I had said that αὐτός “implies the protasis”; but had taken the protasis itself to be, εἰ μὴ ἐξεῖπον, supplied from ἐξερῶ :if I had not thus spoken, —appealing to you for help.]; Then, μὴ οὐκ ἔχων is equivalent to εἰ μὴ εἶχον. Now, the difficulty here seemed to be that εἰ μὴ εἶχον would imply, “but I have a clue”: whereas, in fact, he has none. [;I met this by suggesting that μὴ οὐκ ἔχων expresses the fact (of his having no clue), not simply as a fact, but as a condition, —“in a case where I had no clue”; being equivalent, not to εἰ μὴ εἶχον, but rather to ὅτε μὴ εἶχον.]; Goodwin's answer is that the conditional sentence, written in full, would stand thus, —(1) and (2) denoting respectively the chief protasis, and the subordinate protasis: (1) εἰ μόνος ἴχνευον, οὐκ ἂν μακρὰν ἴχνευον, (2) εἰ μὴ εἶχόν τι σύμβολον. Now (1) is an unreal supposition (he is not tracking alone); and that makes the whole supposition unreal. εἰ μὴ εἶχον is here a part of that unreal supposition; and therefore it can have that form, although, as a fact, he has no clue. (Suppose it to be said of a man too old for work: “If he were young, he would not be doing well, if he did not work”: εἰ νέος ἦν, οὐκ ἂν εὖ ἐποίει, εἰ μὴ ἐπόνει. The chief protasis, εἰ νέος ἦν, being unreal, makes all the rest unreal. The fact is, οὐ πονεῖ: and εἰ μὴ ἐπόνει does not imply, πονεῖ. Compressed, this would be, οὐκ ἂν εὖ ἐποίει νέος ὤν, μὴ οὐ πονῶν. ) αὐτός , unaided: cp. Hom. Il. 13.729 ἀλλ’ οὔπως ἅμα πάντα δυνήσεαι αὐτὸς ἑλέσθαι."}

We might render ὡς ἂν εἴπω μὴ τὰ σ’ either (i) as above, or (ii) “in order that I may not utter thy griefs.” But (i) is preferable for these reasons: —(1) The subjunct. εἴπω with μή was familiar in such phrases.

Lushington's brilliant emendation of πετραῖος ὁ ταῦρος, the reading of the first hand in L. It is at once closer to the letters, and more poetical, than πέτρας ἅτε ταῦρος (Dorville, —where the use of ἅτε is un-Attic), πέτρας ἴσα ταύροις (M. Schmidt), or πέτρας ὡς ταῦρος, which last looks like a prosaic correction. I suppose the corruption to have arisen thus. A transcriber who had before him ΠΕΤΡΑΣΙΣΟΤΑΥΡΟΣ took the first O for the art., and then amended ΠΕΤΡΑΣΙΣ into the familiar word ΠΕΤΡΑΙΟΣ. With a cursive MS. this would have been still easier, since in πετρασισοταυρος the first ς might have been taken for ο (not a rare mistake), and then a simple transposition of ι and the supposed ο would have given πετραιος. It is true that such compounds with ἰσο usu. mean, not merely “like,” but “as good as” or “no better than”: e.g. ἰσοδαίμων, ἰσόθεος, ἰσόνεκυς, ἰσόνειρος, ἰσόπαις, ἰσόπρεσβυς. Here, however, ἰσόταυρος can well mean “wild” or “fierce of heart” as a bull. And we know that in the lost Κρέουσα Soph. used ἰσοθάνατος in a way which seemed too bold to Pollux (6. 174 οὐ πάνυ ἀνεκτόν), —probably in the sense of “dread as death” (cp. Soph.

Reading πρὸς ὅτου δὴ βασανίζων βασάνῳ , I should take πρὸς with βασάνῳ : “testing on the touchstone whereof” —“using which(νεῖκος) as a test.” [;Receiving my βασανίζων, Kennedy (ed. 1885) replaces the word βασάνῳ by πιθανῶς.]; To Brunck's βασάνῳ χρησάμενος ( Plat.

Two other courses of emendation are possible: (i) To supply after ἔμαθον something to express the informant, as τινος ἀστῶν or, προφέροντος, when πρὸς ὅτου would mean “at whose suggestion.” This remedy seems to me improbable. (ii) To supply σύν and an adj. for βασάνῳ, as σὺν ἀληθεῖ β., or β. σὺν φανερᾷ. As the mutilated verse stands in the MSS., it cannot, I think, be translated without some violence to Greek idiom. The most tolerable version would be this: —“setting out from which(πρὸς ὅτου neut., referring to νεῖκος), I can with good warrant(βασάνῳ) assail the public fame of Oed.” Then βασάνῳ would be an instrumental dative equivalent to βάσανον ἔχων: and πρὸς ὅτου would be like 1236 πρὸς τίνος ποτ’ αἰτίας; Soph.

Creon's defence serves to bring out the character of Oedipus by a new contrast. Creon is a man of somewhat rigid nature, and essentially matter-of-fact. In his reasonable indignation, he bases his argument on a calculation of interest (583), insisting on the substance in contrast with the show of power, as in the Antigone his vindication of the written law ignores the unwritten. His blunt anger at a positive wrong is softened by no power of imagining the mental condition in which it was done.

The argument that the stichomuthia should not be broken shows inattention to the practice of Soph. He not seldom breaks a stichomuthia, when a weighty utterance (as here, the king's threat) claims the emphasis of two verses. See (e.g.) 356-369, broken by 366 f. (the seer's denunciation): Soph.

Synizesis of υ is rare in extant Greek poetry: Pind. P. 4.225 γενύ¯ων :Anthol. 11.413 (epigram by Ammianus, 1st century A.D.) ὤκιμον, ἡδύ¯οσμον, πήγανον, ἀσπάραγος. Eur.

It might be rash to say that Soph. could not have used δυοῖν as a monosyllable; for he has used the ordinary synizesis in a peculiarly bold way, Soph. Aj. 1129 μή νυν ἀτίμα θεοὺς θεοῖς σεσωμένος : but at least it moves the strongest suspicion. ἀποκρίνας , on the other hand, seems genuine. ἀποκρίνειν is properly secernere to set apart: e.g. γῆν (Plat. Rep. 303d): or to select: Plat. Laws 946a πλήθει τῶν ψήφων ἀποκρίναντας, having selected (the men) according to the number of votes for each. Here, “having set apart (for me) one of two ills” is a phrase suitable to the arbitrary rigour of doom which left a choice only between death and exile. For δυοῖν Elms. proposed τοῖνδ’ or τοῖνδέ γ’: Herm., τοῖνδ’ ἕν: A. Spengel, δείν’. I should rather believe that δρᾶν was altered into δρᾶσαι by a grammarian who looked to ἀπῶσαι, κτεῖναι , and perh. also sought a simpler order. But for pres. infin. combined with aor. infin. cp. 623 θνῄσκειν … φυγεῖν: Soph. Ant. 204 μήτε κτερίζειν μήτε κωκῦσαι. See also Soph. OC 732 ἥκω γὰρ οὐχ ὡς δρᾶν τι βουληθείς, where in prose we should have expected δρᾶσαι. The quantity of ἀπο‐κρίνας is supported by Aesch. PB 24 ἀπο‐κρύψει· ἀπο‐τροπή and its cognates in Aesch. and Eur.: ἐπι‐κρύπτειν Eur. Supp. 296 : ἐπι‐κράνων Eur. IT 51 . Blaydes conj. δοὺς δυοῖν κρῖναι κακοῖν (i.e. “giving me my choice of two ills”; cp. Soph.

That, however, is Whitelaw's view, who suggests that the original may have been something like φαῦλον αἵρεσίν γ’ ἐμοί. Wolff would compress vv. 640 f. into one, thus: δρᾶσαι δικαιοῖ, δείν’, ἀποκτεῖναι λαβών."}

As regards the form of εἰκάθω, Curtius (Verb 11. 345, Eng. tr. 505), discussing presents in ‐θω and past tenses in ‐θον from vowel stems, warns us against “looking for anything particularly aoristic in the θ” of these verbs. In Greek usage, he holds, “a decidedly aoristic force” for such forms as σχεθεῖν and εἰκαθεῖν“ never established itself”: and he justly cites Soph. El. 1014 as a place where εἰκαθεῖν is in no way aoristic. He would therefore keep the traditional accent, and write σχέθειν, εἰκάθειν, with Buttmann. Now, while believing with Curtius that these forms were prob. in origin presents, I also think that in the usage of the classical age they were often aorists: as e.g. σχεθεῖν in Aesch.

But the shock which had befallen her own life, —when at the bidding of Delphi her first-born was sacrificed without saving her husband Laius—has left a deep and bitter conviction that no mortal, be he priest or seer, shares the divine foreknowledge. In the Greek view the μάντις might be (1) first, the god himself, speaking through a divinely frenzied being in whom the human reason was temporarily superseded (hence the popular derivation of μαντική from μανίἀ: Plat. Tim. 71e μαντικὴν ἀφροσύνῃ θεὸς ἀνθρωπίνῃ δέδωκεν· οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἔννους ἐφάπτεται μαντικῆς ἐνθέου καὶ ἀληθοῦς : this was much the same as the Egyptian belief, Hdt. 2.83 μαντικὴ δὲ αὐτοῖσι ὦδε διακέεται. ἀνθρώπων μὲν οὐδενὶ προσκέεται ἡ τέχνη, τῶν δὲ θεῶν μετεξετέροισι. (2) Secondly, the μάντις might be a man who reads signs from birds, fire, etc., by rule of mystic science: it was against this τέχνη that scepticism most readily turned: Eur. El. 399 Λοξίου γὰρ ἔμπεδοι | χρησμοί, βροτῶν δὲ μαντικὴν χαίρειν λέγω. Iocasta means: “I will not say that the message came through the lips of a truly god-possessed interpreter; but at any rate it came from the priests; it was an effort of human μαντική.” So in 946, 953 θεῶν μαντεύματα are oracles which professed to come from the gods. Others render: — “Nothing in mortal affairs is connected with the mantic art”: i.e. is affected by it, comes within its ken. Then ἐστὶν ἔχον will not stand for ἔχεται (which it could not do), but for ἔχει, as meaning “is of,” “belongs to.” Hdt. has ἔχειν as = εἶναι with expressions equivalent to an adverb, as Hdt. 2.91 ἀγῶνα γυμνικὸν διὰ πάσης ἀγωνίης ἔχοντα, “consisting in every sort of contest,” as he might have said πολυτρόπως ἔχοντα: so Hdt. 3.128 περὶ πολλῶν ἔχοντα πρηγμάτων ( = πολλαχῶς): Hdt. 6.42 κατὰ χώρην ( = ἐμπέδως) ἔχοντες· Hdt. 7.220 ἐν ἔπεσιἑξαμέτροισι ἔχοντα. But such instances are wholly different from the supposed use of ἔχειν alone as = εἶναι with a partitive genitive."}

The following is from my notes taken on the spot: — “A bare isolated hillock of grey stone stands at the point where our path from Daulia meets the road to Delphi, and a third road that stretches to the south. There, in front, we are looking up the road down which Oedipus came [from Delphi]; we are moving in the steps of the man whom he met and slew; the road runs up a wild and frowning pass between Parnassus on the right hand and on the left the spurs of the Helicon range, which here approach it. Away to the south a wild and lonely valley opens, running up among the waste places of Helicon, a vista of naked cliffs or slopes clothed with scanty herbage, a scene of inexpressible grandeur and desolation” (Modern Greece p. 79). At this σχιστὴ ὁδός Pausanias saw τὰ τοῦ Λαΐου μνήματα καὶ οἰκέτου τοῦ ἑπομένου: the legend was that Damasistratus king of Thebes had found the bodies and buried them (10. 5 sect. 4).

The oracular art having failed in this instance, I refuse to heed Teiresias when he says that you will yet be found guilty of slaying your father Polybus.” Iocasta, bent on cheering Oedipus, merely alludes to the possibility of his being indeed the slayer of Laius (851), and turns to the comforting aspect of the case—viz., the undoubted failure of the oracle, on any supposition. This fine and subtle passage is (to my apprehension) utterly defaced by the conjecture σόν γε Λαΐου φόνον (Bothe), “it cannot be shown that your slaying of Laius fulfils the oracle.” Herm. reads τόνδε, “this slaying” (of which you think yourself guilty): but the γε is needed."}

These traits furnish the two interwoven themes of the second stasimon: (1) the prayer for purity in word as in deed: (2) the deprecation of that pride which goes before a fall; —whether it be the insolence of the τύραννος, or such intellectual arrogance as Iocasta's speech bewrays (λόγῳ, v. 884). The tone of warning reproof towards Oedipus, while only allusive, is yet in contrast with the firm though anxious sympathy of the former ode, and serves to attune the feeling of the spectators for the approach of the catastrophe. 1st strophe (863-872). May I ever be pure in word and deed, loyal to the unwritten and eternal laws. 1st antistrophe (873-882). A tyrant's selfish insolence hurls him to ruin. But may the gods prosper all emulous effort for the good of the State. 2nd strophe (883-896). Irreverence in word or deed shall not escape: the wrath of the gods shall find it out. 2nd antistrophe (897-910).

We can hardly say more than this:—(i) There is no positive probability as to the date of the play which can be set against such a view. (2) The language suits it, -nay, might well suggest it; nor does it matter that the Ἑρμαῖ, though ἀναθήματα (Andoc. 1.34), were not properly ἕδη. (3) It cannot be assumed that the dramatic art of Sophocles would exclude such a reference. Direct contemporary allusion is, indeed, uncongenial to it. But a light touch like this—especially in a choral ode—might fitly strike a chord of contemporary feeling in unison with the emotion stirred by the drama itself. I do not see how to affirm or to deny that such a suggestion was meant here. (Cp. Soph. OC 1537 n.)"}

For Soph., as for Aesch. and Eur., our MSS. on the whole favour αὕτως: but their authority cannot be presumed to represent a tradition older than, or independent of, the grammarians.

When Plato says τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ … πρόνοιαν (Plat. Tim. 30c ),προνοίας θεῶν (Plat. Tim. 44c), the phrase is no more than Herodotus had used before him, Hdt. 3.108 τοῦ θείου ἡ προνοίη. The meaning of Favorinus was that Plato first established in philosophy the conception of a divine providence, though popular language had known such a phrase before. Note that in Soph. OC 1180 πρόνοια τοῦ θεοῦ = ”reverence for the god “: in Eur. Phoen. 637 a man acts θείᾳ προνοίᾳ = ”with inspired foresight “: in Xen. Mem. 1.4.6 προνοητικῶς = not, “providentially,” but simply, ”with forethought. “"}

The substitution of a hyporcheme for a regular stasimon has here a twofold dramatic convenience. It shortens the interval of suspense; and it prepares a more forcible contrast. For the sake of thus heightening the contrast, Soph. has made a slight sacrifice of probability. The sudden exit of Iocasta has just affected the Chorus with a dark presentiment of evil (1075). We are now required to suppose that the spirited words of Oedipus (1076-1085) have completely effaced this impression, leaving only delight in the prospect that he will prove to be a native of the land. A hyporcheme is substituted for a stasimon with precisely similar effect in the Ajax, where the short and joyous invocation of Pan immediately precedes the catastrophe (693-717). The stasimon in Soph. Trach. 633-662 may also be compared, in so far as its glad anticipations usher in the beginning of the end. Strophe (1086-1097).

(In the above explanation, the act. voice of νέμω has been used, since this was specially said of shepherds: cp. Xen. Cyrop. 3.2.20 ἐπεὶ ὄρη ἀγαθὰ ἔχετε, ἐθέλοιτ’ ἂν ἐᾶν νέμειν ταῦτα τοὺς Ἀρμενίους; The midd. would also be correct, as = “to range over. ”) For the irregular but very common change of participle into finite verb cp.

Though we can have δῶμα πελάζει (Eur.

The text is probably sound. Heimsoeth's conjecture, νέμων for ὁ μέν, with ἐπλησίαζε , is attractive, but the parenthetic ἐγὼ δ’ ἑνί is then very awkward. Nauck proposes ἐν Κιθαιρῶνος νάπαις | (this with Blaydes) νομεὺς διπλοῖσι ποιμνίοις ἐπιστατῶν | ἐπλησίαζε: but this is to re-write, not to correct."}

Aj. 34 ). Modern Greek regularly uses the accus. for the old temporal dat.: e. g. τὴν τρίτην ἡμέραν for τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ. Classical prose would here use the genit.: Thuc. 1.30 χειμῶνος ἤδη ἀνεχώρησαν. The division of the year implied is into ἔαρ, θέρος (including ὀπώρἀ, and χειμών (including φθινόπωρον)."}

I conjecture δύρομαι γὰρ ὥσπερ ἰάλεμον χέων | ἐκ στομάτων : “I lament as one who pours from his lips a dirge ”: i.e., Oedipus is to me as one who is dead. Cp. Pind. I. 7.58 ἐπὶ θρῆνον … πολύφαμον ἔχεαν, “over the tomb they poured forth a resounding dirge. ” My emendation has been adopted by Prof. Kennedy (ed. 1885). Every attempt to explain the vulgate is unavailing. (1) ὡς περίαλλ’ is supposed to be like ὡς ἐτητύμως, ὡς μάλιστα, “in measure most abundant. ” Now περίαλλα could mean only “preeminently,” “more than others”: Soph. fr. 225 νόμων | οὓς Θαμύρας περίαλλα μουσοποιεῖ, “strains which Thamyras weaves with art preeminent”: Aristoph. Thes. 1070 τί ποτ’ Ἀνδρομέδα | περίαλλα κακῶν μέρος ἐξέλαχον; “why have I, Andromeda, been dowered with sorrows above all women?” Pind. P. 11.5 θησαυρὸν ὂν περίαλλ’ ἐτίμασε Λοξίας, honoured preeminently. Here, περίαλλα is utterly unsuitable; and the added ὡς makes the phrase stranger still. (2) The MSS. have ἰαχέων . Both ἰα^χεῖν and ἰα—χεῖν occur: but the latter should, with Dindorf, be written ἰακχέω. Eur. Her. 752 ἰακχήσατε : 783 ὀλολύγματα … ἰακχεῖ: Eur. Orest. 826 Τυνδαρὶς ἰάκχησε τάλαινα : 965 ἰακχείτω δὲ γᾶ Κυκλωπία. The participle, however, is unendurably weak after δύρομαι , and leaves ἐκ στομάτων weaker still. (3) ἐκ στομάτων can mean only “from my lips” (the plur. as Soph. Trach. 938 ἀμφιπίπτων στόμασιν, kissing her lips: Eur. Alc. 404 ποτὶ σοῖσι πίτνων στόμασιν) : it could not mean “loudly. ” (4) Elmsley, doubtless feeling this, took ἰαχέων as gen. of a supposed, but most questionable, ἰαχέος, “loud,” formed from ἰαχή. Erfurdt conjectured ἰακχίων , “from lips wild as a bacchant's.” But a Greek poet would not have brought Iacchos and Thanatos so close together; χωρὶς ἡ τιμὴ θεῶν. (5) ἰάλεμον gives exactly the right force; for them, Oed. is as the dead. ἰάλεμος is a wail for the dead in the four places of Eur. where it occurs (Eur. Orest. 1391,Eur. Phoen. 1033,Eur. Tro. 600,Eur. Tro. 1304), in Eur. Rh. 895, and in the one place of Aesch. Supp. 115, which is just to our point: the Chorus of Danaides say, πάθεα … θρεομένα … | ἰηλέμοισιν ἐμπρεπῆ ζῶσα γόοις με τιμῶ, “lamenting sorrows meet for funeral wails (i.e. the sorrows of those who are as dead), while yet living, I chant mine own dirge.” ἐκ στομάτων fits χέων , since χεῖν was not commonly used absolutely for “to utter” (as by Pindar, l. c. above). (6) The corruption may have thus arisen in a cursive MS.: ἰάλεμον being written ἰαλεμὸ, the last five letters of ὡσπεριαλεμοχ῎ων would first generate αχεων (as in one MS.), or, with the second stroke of the μ, ιαχεων: the attempt to find an intelligible word in the immediately preceding group of letters would then quickly produce the familiar περίαλλα (in one MS. περίαλἀ. The nonelision of the final α in the MSS. favours this view. As to metre, with πατρὶ in 1209, a tribrach (‐τρὶ θαλαμ) answers to a dactyl (ὡς περι‐, my ὥσπερ ἰ‐), whether we keep the traditional text, or adopt my conjecture, or that of Wecklein or of Burges; though Wecklein, by a strange oversight, has noticed this objection as if it were peculiar to my conjecture. Wunder's πόσει for πατρὶ in 1209 would restore exact correspondence, and may be right; but I rather prefer, with Heinrich Schmidt (Compositionslehre 64), to regard the ὡς as an “irrational syllable ”: see Metrical Analysis."}

Verb 1.138, Eng. tr. 92: “It seems to me best on all grounds to suppose that shortly before the rise of the Greek Epic the [syllabic] augment became occasionally exposed to the same tendency towards wearing away (Verwitterung) which the ἀ of ἄρα and the ἐ of ἔνερθε could not always withstand; that there were, in short, pairs of forms then in use, one with the augment and one without … The omission of the syllabic augment in Homer was purely a matter of choice … Post-Homeric poetry adopts the power of dispensing with the syllabic augment as an inheritance from its predecessor, and makes the greater use of it in proportion as it is removed from the language of ordinary life. Hence it is that, as is shown by the careful investigations made by Renner (Stud. 1.2.18 ff.), the omission of the syllabic augment is extremely rare in iambic, and far more common in elegiac and lyric verse. Hence, as is shown (Stud. 1.2.259) by Gerth, in the dialogue of tragedy the range of this license is very limited indeed, while the majority of instances of it occur in the slightly Epic style of the messengers” speeches, or still more commonly in lyric passages. “ The tragic ῥήσεις here borrow from a practice more marked in epic narrative than in epic speeches. In Homer, where augmented and unaugmented forms are on the whole about equally numerous, the proportion of augmented to unaugmented is in the speeches about 10 to 3, in the narrative about 5 to 7: see Monro, Hom.

The pressure of Oedipus on the outer side forces the bolts, causing them to bend inwards ( κοῖλα ).So Oedipus, within the house, gives the order διοίγειν κλῇθρα, 1287.

Andr. 1166 φοράδην … δῶμα πελάζει, i.e. borne in a litter: Dem. 54.20 ὑγιὴς ἐξελθὼν φοράδην ἦλθον οἴκαδε. Such adverbs in ‐δην, which were probably accusatives cognate to the notion of the verb, are always formed from the verbal stem, (a) directly, like βά‐δην, or (b) with modified vowel and inserted α, like φοράδην instead of * φερδην, σποράδην instead of * σπερδην."}

This could not be used with the imperfect of a verb of motion (as ἵνα ἔβαινε, instead of οἷ), but only with the perfect, as ἵνα βέβηκε (i.e. where is he now) or the aorist when equivalent to the perfect: as Soph. OC 273 ἱκόμην (I have come) ἵν’ ἱκόμην. So, here, the aor. alone seems admissible: ἵν’ ἐξήλου , where hast thou leaped to, i.e. where art thou? cp. 1515 ἵν’ ἐξήκεις, and see on 947."}

Oedipus had been the all-admired (8), the “saviour of the land ” (48). But now the Theban elders wish that they had never so much as heard his name or looked upon his face. That bitter cry is drawn from them by the very strength of their sympathy: for his ruin was the result of his coming to Thebes. The objections to the reading of the MSS., ὥς σ’ ἠθέλησα μηδ’ ἀναγνῶναί ποτε , are these: (1) Eur. Hel. 290 has the 1st aor. pass., ἀνεγνώσθημεν ἄν, “we should have been recognised ”: but ἀναγιγνώσκειν occurs nowhere else in tragedy; and in Attic its regular sense was “to read,” or in the 1st aor. act., “to persuade.” I have not found a single example of ἀναγιγνώσκω as = ἀναγνωρίζω ( “to recognise ”) in Thuc., Plato, Xen., or the Orators. (2) But the 2nd aor. has that sense in Homer, in Pind. I. 2.23 and in Hdt. 2.91: may not an Attic poet have followed them? Granted. The sense required here, however, after μηδέ , is to know, not to recognise: the latter would be pointless. (3) The ellipse of ἄν with the aor. ἠθέλησα would be strangely harsh. Such an ellipse with the imperf. sometimes occurs: as Antiph. 5.1 ἐβουλόμην (and so Aristoph. Frogs 866), Antiph. 5.86 ἠξίουν. But if, as seems clear, ἄν is required here, then the probability is strengthened that ἀναγνῶναι arose from ἂν γνῶναι . Between Dindorf's ὡς ἠθέλησα μηδέ σ’ ἂν γνῶναι and Hermann's ὥς σ’ ἠθέλησα μηδέ γ’ ἂν γνῶναι the question is: Which is more likely to have passed into the reading of the MSS.? Now they have ὥς σ’ , and the loss of γ’ through a confusion with the same letter in γνῶναι is slightly more probable than the double error of omitting σ’ before ἂν and inserting it afterὡς."}

It would require an improbable alteration in the strophe (see on 1330); and it yields no good sense. The Scholiasts hesitated between rendering it (1) “feeding on my flesh ”! or (2) “in the pastures.” Reading νομάδ’ , we have a dochmiac dimeter, agreeing with 1330: see Metrical Analysis. But the use of the word is extraordinary. It must mean ἐν νομαῖς, “in the pastures”—said of the babe whom the shepherd had been ordered to expose on Cithaeron. Now elsewhere νομάς always means “ roaming,” said (e.g.) of pastoral tribes, or of animals: Soph. Trach. 271 ἵππους νομάδας ἐξιχνοσκοπῶν, tracking horse that had strayed: fr. 87 νομὰς δέ τις κεροῦσσ’ ἀπ’ ὀρθίων πάγων | καθεῖρπεν ἔλαφος: of waters wandering over the land which they irrigate, Soph. OC 686 κρῆναι … | Κηφισοῦ νομάδες ῥεέθρων. The idea of wandering movement is inseparable from the word. To apply it to a babe whose feet were pinned together would have been indeed a bold use. Prof. Campbell, retaining νομάδος, takes πέδας as acc. plur.: “that loosed the cruel clog upon my feet, when I was sent astray.” But could νομάς, ‘roaming, ’ be said of the maimed child merely in the sense of ‘turned adrift’ by its parents? The nomin. νομὰς , referring to the roving shepherd (πλάνης 1029) would be intelligible; but the quadruple ‐ας is against it. Now cp. Aesch. Pers. 734 μονάδα δὲ Ξέρξην ἔρημον, “Xerxes alone and forlorn. ” Simply transposing ν and μ I conjecture μονάδ’ , a word appropriate to the complaint that the babe, sent to the lonely mountain, had not been left to perish in its solitude. The fact that the Corinthian shepherd received the child from the Theban is no objection: the child was φίλων μεμονωμένος, desolate and forlorn. ἔλυσ’ , which suits the dochmiac as well as ἔλαβέ μ’, is more forcible here. There is a further argument for it. The MSS. give ἀπ’ ἀγρίας in 1349, but the strophe (1329) shows that ἀπ’ must be omitted, since Ἀπόλλων, φίλοι = ὃς ἀγρίας πέδας , the first syllable of ἀγρίας being short, as in 1205, Soph. Ant. 344, 1124. Now πέδας (i.e. πέδης) ἔλαβε ,took from the fetter, would be too harsh: we could only do as Schneidewin did, and refer ἀπό back to πέδας : but though Δελφῶν κἀπὸ Δαυλίας (734) admits of such treatment, the case is dissimilar here. On the other hand πέδας ἔλυσ’ ,loosed from the fetter, is correct. Thus the metrical impossibility of ἀπ’ confirms ἔλυσ’ . The epithet ἀγρία, “cruel, ” is applied to πέδη as it is to ὀδύνη in Soph. Trach. 975."}

Had his parents meant him to live in lonely misery on Cithaeron, there would be some point in calling it his “living grave. ” But they meant him to die there forthwith (cp. 1174); ζῶντι, then, would mean nothing more than that the grave was chosen before the babe was dead. κύριον appointed by their authoritative decision: cp.

To feel the force of this passage, we must remember how closely the Greek festivals were bound up with the life of the family. Kinsfolk took part in them together: and at such moments a domestic disgrace, such as that which the sisters inherited, would be most keenly felt. In Athenian law-courts the fact of association at festivals could be cited in evidence of family intimacy: Isoc. 19.10 ἕως μὲν γὰρ παῖδες ἦμεν, περὶ πλέονος ἡμᾶς αὐτοὺς ἡγούμεθα ἢ τοὺς ἀδελφούς, καὶ οὔτε θυσίαν οὔτε θεωρίαν (public spectacle) οὔτ’ ἄλλην ἑορτὴν οὐδεμίαν χωρὶς ἀλλήλων ἤγομεν.

It was the Attic custom for a bridegroom Θεσμοφόρια ἑστιᾶν τὰς γυναῖκας, to provide a banquet at the next Thesmophoria for the women of his deme (Isaeus 3.80), and also φράτορσι γαμηλίαν εἰσφέρειν, to provide a banquet for his clansmen when his bride was introduced into his φρατρία (Isaeus 8.18)."}

Some word or act reminds the daughters of Oedipus that they are thus regarded, and they go home in tears. Greek sensitiveness to public notice on such occasions might be illustrated by the story in Herodotus of the affront offered to the deposed king Demaratus by his successor Leotychides at the Spartan festival of the γυμνοπαιδίαι (Hdt. 6.67). Demaratus drew his robe over his head, and left the theatre: κατακαλυψάμενος ἤϊε ἐκ τοῦ θεήτρου ἐς τὰ ἑωυτοῦ οἰκία.

Aj. 503 οἵας λατρείας ἀνθ’ ὅσου ζήλου τρέφει. I doubt, however, whether ἐπέβλεπεν, without ζήλῳ, could mean “admired.” On the usage of the verb ἐπιβλέπω, see Appendix."}

I take the exact sense to be: —“fixing one's eye on the final day (as on a point towards which one is moving), that one should see it,” i.e. “until one shall have had experience of it.” Thus ἐπισκοπεῖν is used in a sense closely akin to its common sense of “attentively considering” a thing: and the whole phrase is virtually equivalent to, “waiting meditatively to see the final day.” For the added infin., cp. Thuc. 3.2 νεῶν ποίησιν ἐπέμενον τελεσθῆναι, καὶ ὅσα ἐκ τοῦ Πόντου ἔδει ἀφικέσθαι. Cp. Plin. NH 7.132 alius de alio iudicat dies, et tamen supremus de omnibus, ideoque nullis credendum est. Hartung proposed to replace ἰδεῖν by γε δεῖ (where γε would be intolerable); Stanley by ἔδει, Seyffert by δέον, and Nauck by χρεών. Kennedy, keeping ἰδεῖν, changes ἐκείνην into ἄμεινον. But the infin. ὀλβίζειν as a “sententious” imperative (see on 462) is appropriate in this γνώμη. The accus. (θνητὸν ὄντ’, ἐπισκοποῦντἀ stands with the infin. when, as here, the infin. represents an imperat. of the third person; cp. Hom. Il. 3.284 εἰ δέ κ’ Ἀλέξανδρον κτείνῃ ξανθὸς Μενέλαος, | Τρῶας ἔπειθ’ Ἑλένην καὶ κτήματα πάντ’ ἀποδοῦναι, with Leaf's note: and Madvig Gr. sect. 546. When the infin. = an imperat. of the second pers., the case is regularly the nom. (Hom. Od. 11.441), rarely the acc. (Hes. WD 389). The view that ὀλβίζειν depends on ὥστε requires a shorter pause at ἐλήλυθεν, and thus weakens the effect of v. 1527. μηδέν’ ὀλβίζειν .Eur. Andr. 100 ff. partly reproduces the language of this passage: χρὴ δ’ οὔποτ’ εἰπεῖν οὐδέν’ ὄλβιον βροτῶν, | πρὶν ἂν θανόντος τὴν τελευταίαν ἴδῃς | ὅπως περάσας ἡμέραν ἥξει κάτω. He has the thought also in Eur. Tro. 510,Eur. Her. 866,Eur. IA 161, as Soph. in Soph. Tr. 1 and fr. 588. The maxim, “Call no man happy before death,” first appears in Greek literature as a set γνώμη in Aesch. Ag. 928 ὀλβίσαι δὲ χρὴ | βίον τελευτήσαντ’ ἐν εὐεστοῖ φίλῃ : but Aristotle recognises the popular tradition which ascribed it to Solon. In Hdt. 1.32 Solon says that a man may be called εὐτυχής in life, but ὄλβιος only after a life exempt from reverse. Cp. Iuv. 10.274 ff. Et Croesum, quem vox iusti facunda Solonis Respicere ad longae iussit spatia ultima vitae, where Mayor refers to the proverbs Λυδὸς (Croesus) ἀποθνήσκει σοφὸς ἀνήρ, and τέλος ὅρα βίου (Parmoemiogr. 11. 187, I. 315 n.), and to notices of the saying in Cic. (De Fin. 2.87, 3.76), Diog. Laert. ( Diog. Laert. 1.50 τά θρυλούμενα ), Ovid (Ovid Met. 3.135), Seneca (De Tranq. An. 11.12), Josephus (Bell. Iud. 1.5.11=29.3), Arrian (7 sect. 16.7), Lucian ( Charon 10): cp. Ecclus. 11. 28. Does Solon mean, Aristotle asks, (1) that a man is happy when he is dead? Or (2) that, after death, he may be said to have been happy? If (1), Arist. declines to allow that the dead are positively happy; and popular opinion, he says, denies that they are always negatively so, i.e. free from unhapppiness. If (2), then is it not absurd that at the time when he ishappy we are not to call him so? The fallacy, he concludes, consists in treating “happiness” as dependant on bright fortunes:οὐ γάρ ἐν ταύταις τὸ εὖ ἢ κακῶς ἀλλὰ προσδεῖται τούτων ὁ ἀνθρωπος βίος, καθάπερ εἴπαμεν, κύριαι δ’ εἰσὶν αἱ κατ’ ἀρετὴν ἐνέργειαι τῆς εὐδαιμονιας, αἱ δ’ ἐναντίαι τοῦ ἐναντίου. (Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1.11)"}
